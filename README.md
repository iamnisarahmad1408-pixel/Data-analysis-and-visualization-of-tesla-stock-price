# Data-analysis-and-visualization-of-tesla-stock-price
The project was to analyse Tesla stock price to predict some trends The graphs show the relationship between the actual values of the closing price of Tesla stock and the predicted values from the linear regression model The points are scattered around the line of best fit, which indicates that the model can make reasonably accurate predictions.
However, there is some variation between the actual and predicted values, which suggests that the model is not perfect.
